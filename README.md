# loruki-website
Cloud hosting website 
This was a code along project created by Brad Traversy - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0bGHP-PXD4
The aim of this project is to familiarise myself with css grid and flexbox. 
I also learnt about building custom CSS frameworks. 
Entire site has been deployed to Netlify with the contents entered into the onsite form also stored here. 
I have not learnt a new method of deployment, I intend to use this for an upcoming project.
